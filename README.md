# Neo4j.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/glesica/Neo4j.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/glesica/Neo4j.jl)

A REST client for the [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org) graph database. Documentation to
follow soon-ish. For now, you can have a look at the test file to see how it is
used. Note that this is crazy alpha-level code, the API **will** change.
